Carbon Footprint Analysis with Power BI
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of global carbon emissions using Power BI. It includes visualizations such as a Filled Map and a Stacked Area Chart to track emission trends over time and across countries. The report is built from a dataset containing sector-wise carbon footprint data and highlights key insights for environmental monitoring and decision-making.

Sector-Wise Carbon Footprint Analysis
This page presents an interactive overview of carbon emissions by sector. Using visuals like a Stacked Column Chart and Pie Chart, it compares the contributions of various sectors such as energy, transport, industry, and agriculture. Key insights such as the highest and lowest emitting sectors are clearly highlighted using Card visuals. Users can filter data by sector to explore specific emission patterns, making it easier to understand where the largest environmental impact comes from.

Region-Wise Emissions Overview
The third page focuses on analyzing carbon emissions by country or region. A Filled Map visualization is used to display geographic patterns in carbon output, allowing users to visually identify high-emission areas. A Stacked Area Chart is also included to show trends over time, highlighting how emissions have changed across countries or continents. This page supports regional analysis and helps in understanding which parts of the world contribute most to carbon emissions, aiding in targeted sustainability strategies.
